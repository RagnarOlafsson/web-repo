# UMDCTF 2023 - OSINT and Forensics Writeup

Since OSINT is one of my very favorite ways of obtaining information and I am fascinated by the community and results that could be achieved, I have participated in the geolocation OSINT challenges - mainly `Gone Missing 1-3`. As a bonus, I am adding a writeup of a very nice forensics challenge `Fire Type Pokemon Only`.

## Gone Missing 1 - OSINT
