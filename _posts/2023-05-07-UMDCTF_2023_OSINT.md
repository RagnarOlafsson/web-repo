Since OSINT is one of my very favorite ways of obtaining information and I am fascinated by the community and results that could be achieved, I have participated in the geolocation OSINT challenges - mainly `Gone Missing 1-3`. As a bonus, I am adding a writeup of a very nice forensics challenge `Fire Type Pokemon Only`.

## Gone Missing 1 - OSINT

All of the 3 OSINT challenges are hosted on <https://gone-missing.chall.lol/>. They follow the same gamified geolocation like Geoguesser, we see a Google Maps image taken directly from the API. 

In the first challenge, we are presented with this picture. ![Gone Missing 1](assets/img/2023_05_07_UMDCTF_2023_OSINT/gonemissing1.png){: width="972" height="589" .w-75 .normal}

Luckily for me, this building reminded me of something, I have seen that in my life already. I had a suspicion that this is Det kongelinge slott, the King's palace in Oslo. However I needed to make sure I am right and also find the exact spot where the picture was taken. I printscreened the building and used Google reverse image search to confirm my suspicion. Google results confirmed my suspicion and I went to Google Maps to find the exact spot. This was not very difficult to do since we see that the picture was taken from the grass on the right side of the park. Going through the 5 different pictures, I found the correct spot - the most distant on the right side.

After clicking on the map on the exact spot, I was presented with the flag.
